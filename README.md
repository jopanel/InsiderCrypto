What this is:

This is a company I was building in 2017. It is a cryptocurrency arbitrage finding SaaS tool. A customer signs up, pays (currently in Lisk), adds the exchanges they are a part of, and then sees a list of arbitrage opportunities. As well as what I like to call Pair Trading. Arbitrage in this sense is when you buy Bitcoin at exchange A for $100, transfer the bitcoin to exchange B, and sell for $110, making a 10% profit. It also does Pair Trading which is it calculates Bitcoin/EUR price is $100 for a bitcoin and Bitcoin/JAP is $110 for a bitcoin. So you can purchase the cryptocurrency in a foreign currency and sell for another currency to make a profit on the same exchange or cross exchange.

Originally developed in CodeIgniter I recoded this in Laravel. I cancelled the project and made this public because the database I was working with CryptoCompare API was NOT GOOD. The data is just simply lacking. Also DeFi exchanges like UniSwap, Trader JOE, etc. make it difficult to make any money doing arbitrage. Currently only CoinMarketCap offers the best API and at the time of writing costs $500 /mo for the app needs. I gave up because I am not wealthy enough to invest and have many other ideas.
