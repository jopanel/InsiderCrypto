          <div id="#a1-what-is-arbitrage-in-trading"><p><b>What is arbitrage in trading?</b> Arbitrage trading is the action of buying a currency, stock, or other commoditiy and transferring it to another exchange/market to sell for a profit. Every exchange has its own market. Not every holder of the commodity is apart of the exchange. Therefore occasionally the price may fluctuate strongly between two markets. In this case investors have an opporunity to make a profit transferring to the exchange that is selling at a higher price.</p>
