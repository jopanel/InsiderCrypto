          <div id="a1-what-is-arbitrage-in-trading"><p><b>What is arbitrage in trading?</b> Arbitrage trading is the action of buying a currency, stock, or other commoditiy and transferring it to another exchange/market to sell for a profit. Every exchange has its own market. Not every holder of the commodity is apart of the exchange. Therefore occasionally the price may fluctuate strongly between two markets. In this case investors have an opporunity to make a profit transferring to the exchange that is selling at a higher price.</p>
          </div>

          <div id="a2-what-is-pair-events"><p><b>What is arbitrage pair events?</b> Pair events are similar to arbitrage pair events. However in this particular case you stay in the same exchange but transfer funds between different markets for certain currencies to make a profit. For example if exchange X has a pair event opportunity to make money buying currency Z in market Z with Q currency. Then trading Z currency in market Y to make money.</p>
          </div>
          <div id="a3-what-is-an-exchange"><p><b>What is an exchange?</b> An exchange is a organization or business that's main operation is trading currency. Often times it is a website to allow consumers (you) to do the trading yourself. Without the use of a broker. Often times there are fees associated with making trades, depositing funds, or transferring funds.</p>
          </div>
          <div id="a4-what-does-the-threshold-mean"><p><b>What does the threshold mean?</b> We offer the ability to set showing only a particular threshold of profit % that you set. Insider Crypto only collects arbitrage opportunities above 3%. Often times there are fees associated with depositing, withdrawing, and trading cryptocurrency. This is your job to check and make sure if you're making a 3% profitable opportunity that you will actually make a profit.</p>
          </div>
          <div id="a5-what-is-ai-and-what-does-it-do-here"><p><b>What is AI and what does it do here?</b> AI is Artificial Intelligence. We use AI deep learning algoirthim to progressively help determine if an opportunity is too good to be true. Is an opportunity that will have a faster closing time. As well to provide internal statistics to help build on for future uses. Our goal using AI is to help you make money.</p>
          </div>
          <div id="a6-what-is-a-symbol-or-market"><p><b>What is a symbol or market?</b> A market can be two different things: an exchange, or a particular symbol to currency economy. A symbol is when an exchange allows trading between multiple currencies purely based for a particular currency. For example if an exchange offeres two different markets using two different symbols (LSK-BTC, ETH-BTC, USD-BTC) and (LSK-ETH, BTC-ETH, USD-ETH) in this particular case the symbols are BTC and ETH. The markets are ETH and BTC economy on the exchange.</p>
          </div>
          <div id="b1-is-there-instructions-on-how-to-trade-cryptocurrencies"><p><b>Is there instructions on how to trade cryptocurrencies?</b> We do not offer training, instructions, or help on trading cryptocurrency.</p>
          </div>
          <div id="b2-what-does-updated-mean-and-why-is-it-old"><p><b>What does updated mean and why is it old?</b> Updated can be relatively old (by hours or even days) however it is either because of two things. Either we haven't received the latest data or more likely there hasn't been any new trades. Often times our data is related to what happend in a sell order which may create the opportunity of arbitrage or pair event. Often times it is related to low volume markets.</p>
          </div>
          <div id="b3-what-is-the-number-next-to-the-opportunity"><p><b>What is the number next to the opportunity?</b> The number is the opportunity identifier. It is unique to the opporunity and it is used for error reporting, chat, and sharing.</p>
          </div>
          <div id="b4-are-some-currencies-not-tradable"><p><b>Are some currencies not tradable?</b> Our data is very good. However sometimes exchanges may temporarily disable depositing, withdrawing, or trading a currency at any given time. During this time it may make very large profit thresholds to be displayed on your dashboard. We do not take responsibility for any losses that may occur during attempting to achieve a profit. We have no control over what an exchange does.</p>
          </div>
          <div id="b5-how-is-the-percentage-calculated"><p><b>How is the percentage calculated?</b> The percentage on a basic level is algebraicly calculated between the same currency trading with the same symbol in a different market. On an more adavnced level it is calculated using the same USD-BTC price or USD-COIN based on the highest volume exchanges. We use coinbase to find our BTC-USD cost. Then calculate profit percentages between multi currency pair or arbitrage opportunities. We do not take fees, risk, or market average into equation.</p>
          </div>
          <div id="b6-do-you-have-access-to-my-cryptocurrency"><p><b>Do you have access to my cryptocurrency?</b> Not at all. We do not have access to any exchanges you are apart of. You do not enter any username or password combinations that are the same with exchanges you use. We do not have the ability to easily reverse engineer your passwords. Your passwords on our website are MD5 + salt encrypted. If you send us your username and password to an exchange we will not log in. Your message will be deleted and likely you may be disallowed to use our services. We have no responsibility for any losses you may occur trading or after signing up for our website. We are not a scam, we provide information for opporunities on making money. It is up to you to do your own research and take your own risks to make the profits we show are available.</p>
          </div>
          <div id="b7-does-insider-crypto-gaurantee-anything"><p><b>Does Insider Crypto gaurantee anything?</b> We do not gaurantee anything. It is likely while using our program heavily or even your first time you may lose money. It is possible to make 1 trade per day and be profitable. Even perhaps making a living. However the risk is yours.</p>
          </div>
          <div id="b8-what-risk-is-involved"><p><b>What risk is involved?</b> There are risks that involve trading cryptocurrency. There are risks involved by using our system. The basic risks of trading cryptocurrency is accidentally sending money to the wrong account, buying, and selling at the wrong time. The risks involved using our system is we do not calculate the fees involved in trading. Fees often times vary between user accounts. People who trade larger amounts and more often than others get rewards by having lower fees. Exchanges change their fees very often so we just don't calcualte this. We do not take into consideration if depositing/trading is closed or disabled for a particular coin on an exchange. It is possible even when everything looks perfect you still lose. For example if there is an opportunity to make 10% trading LSK-BTC on exchange X to exchange Y. The depositing/withdraw/trading is enabled. You make the request on exchange X to transfer funds to exchange Y. However exchange X or exchange Y takes a long time to actually send the funds. Also possible that the coin is inflated or transfer fees are not met correctly and the speed is slow. By the time the funds are available on exchange Y the gap is closed and you are selling for lower than you purchased for initially. It could also be profitable in that the cost went up even more and your funds came available and you sold for a much higher profit than 10%. There are risks and rewards for arbitrage or pair events. We take no responsibility for any losses that occur.</p>
          </div>
          <div id="b9-some-of-my-matches-are-not-correct-prices-compared-to-the-exchange"><p><b>Some of my matches are not correct prices compared to the exchange.</b> Currently we do checks on all markets and all exchanges through every currency once every 5 minutes. Also once every 5 minutes we run a check on all matches we find to update those prices specifically. The prices we get are based on the last traded cost. Not what is in the buy or sell order.</p>
          </div>
          <div id="b10-some-of-my-matches-are-not-correct-percentage"><p><b>Some of my matches are not correct percentage?</b> During our checks for prices it is possible that we do not check the profit percentage until we run our checks for the oppporuntiy. Because the opporunity checks are so advanced we have multiple checks for price and multiple checks for opporunties that differ. We try to provide the most up to date price. However it is possible the percentage is inaccurate. In future cases this will go down. However if this is a question you actively have this is the best answer we can provide without getting into how the code is made.
          </p>
          </div>
          <div id="b11-some-of-my-matches-are-not-listed-correctly"><p><b>Some of my matches are not listed correctly?</b> There are multiple levels of a potential match that is not listed correctly. From the buy being where sell should be, currency should be in the symbol spot, and percentage is not accurate. We do everything we can to make sure the data is correct. It is up to you to do your own research and dilligence to make sure any trades you make are a calculated risk you want to take.</p>
          </div>
          <div id="c1-can-i-get-a-refund"><p><b>Can I get a refund?</b> We do not give any refunds for any reasons. It is your responsibility to manage your own purchases, subscriptions, or money. If you are required to send 10 of X coin to us to make a purchase and send over 10 we will not reimburse you. It is also the same if you send too little and want to cancel your order. It is your responsibility to send the right amount, manage your money, and your subscriptions. Again, under no circumstances will you receive currency from us.</p>
